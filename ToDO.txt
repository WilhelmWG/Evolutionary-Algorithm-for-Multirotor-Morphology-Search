Depth-Camera (v)
Controller
- Calculate errors (v?)
- Calculate force and moment (v?)
- Calculate control allocation matrix and allocate forces to rotors (v)
- Figure out if reversed b3 axis makes a difference
- Positive sigma + positive rps = positive force
- F IS OPPOSITE FROM PAPER BUT b3d DEFINED THE SAME AND I THINK I*VE ROTATED THE MATRIX CORRECTLY; SO THIS IS WEIRD
IMU State Estimation: Currently estimating rotation relative to world frame
Higher order RK-method
Finish quad.get_depth_frame(obst) (v)
torque from gravity (Not necessary as long as multirotor is symmetrical about center of mass) (v)
