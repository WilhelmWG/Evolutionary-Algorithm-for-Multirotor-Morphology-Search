ToDo:
IMU State Estimation: Currently estimating rotation relative to world frame
Higher order RK-method

Done:
Depth-Camera (v)
Controller
- Calculate errors (v)
- Calculate force and moment (v)
- Calculate control allocation matrix and allocate forces to rotors (v)
- Figure out if reversed b3 axis makes a difference (v)
- Positive sigma + positive rps = positive force (v)
- F IS OPPOSITE FROM PAPER BUT b3d DEFINED THE SAME AND I THINK I*VE ROTATED THE MATRIX CORRECTLY; SO THIS IS WEIRD (v)

Finish quad.get_depth_frame(obst) (v)
torque from gravity (Not necessary as long as multirotor is symmetrical about center of mass) (v)
